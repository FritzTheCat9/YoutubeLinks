## Project status

Project created as part of the "[100 Commits](https://100commitow.pl)" competition. The challenge is to add changes to
the repository every day for 100 days.

![100 Commits results image](./images/100commitow_results.jpeg)

I achieved 8th place in the "[100 Commits](https://100commitow.pl)" competition organized
by "[DevMentors.io](https://devmentors.io)". Over 100 days, I developed the "YoutubeLinks" application, which allows
users to create playlists from YouTube links and download those playlists as MP3 and MP4 files.

This project was a significant adventure that taught me perseverance and systematic work to achieve my project goals
within the given timeframe. The "[100 Commits](https://100commitow.pl)" gala was a fantastic event, well-organized with
engaging talks. I look forward to a potential second edition of the competition in the future.
